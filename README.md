## Assignment Overview

### Goal

The goal of this assignment is to create a simple React application that demonstrates your skills and knowledge of React, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. In this assignment, you'll be building a basic to-do list application where users can add and remove tasks. This assignment will assess your ability to:

1. Create and manage React components.
2. Use state and props to manage data and communication between components.
3. Handle user interactions and events.
4. Render dynamic content in a React application.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

To begin the assignment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the assignment repository provided by Stazi Technology. You can use a version control tool like Git to clone the repository to your local machine.

### Installing Dependencies

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

### Starting the Development Server

3. **Start the Development Server**: Run `npm start` to initiate the development server. This will launch your React application in your default web browser. You should be able to see the initial application structure.

### Project Structure

4. **Review the Project Structure**: Familiarize yourself with the project structure. You'll likely find a folder for components, styles, and possibly other files like `App.js` or `index.js`.

## Tips for Success

As you work on the assignment, keep the following tips in mind:

- **Break It Down**: Start by breaking the assignment into smaller tasks or components. Identify the main components you'll need to build, such as the task list, task item, and form for adding new tasks.

- **State Management**: Consider how you will manage the state of your application. Think about where you need to store the list of tasks and how you will update it when users add or remove tasks.

- **Component Design**: Pay attention to the design and layout of your components. Consider using CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution to style your application.

- **Testing**: Test your components and features thoroughly to ensure they work as expected. You can use tools like Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing.

- **Documentation**: Document your code, especially if you create custom components or functions. Clear and well-commented code is essential.

- **Styling**: Make your application visually appealing by applying appropriate styling. Consider using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI if necessary.

- **Error Handling**: Think about how you will handle errors or edge cases in your application, such as empty tasks or invalid input.
